# Load Balancing using MAS

This application proposes a new way to do network load balancing using a MAS (Multi Agent System).

This allows the load balancing to be distributed (i.e. decentralized), use low resources, handle uncertainty in a better way, and to deal with the dynamic nature of load balancing. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install the load balancer application.

1. First clone the repo
2. In the root of the cloned repo, run the following

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage
Run the ```run.py``` file in __src__ directory to use the application.
